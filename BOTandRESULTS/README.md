A bot that runs the run-contest archive on sourdough/datagrump repo, it needs to be adapted to the size of the screen. Just used to test my skills and also help me in a class work that demand so much time manually.\

The .txt files are the results of the bot cicles, it runs run-contest 15 times wich each window size from 10 to 100, five by five, like 10,15,20,25...
